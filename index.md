### [Advanced Data Analysis: Regression Variable Selection ](https://github.com/GrahamChalfant/Advanced_Data_Analysis_Project)

This project was based on the SkillCraft_Dataset.csv. The SkillSet_Dataset file contains video game telemetric data from a cognitive study of a Complex SKill Leaning project.

Objective: What affects the expert level? How can the players improve their level?

- Created loop to find r-squared of each independent variable
- Rearranged data using dplyr package to list variables in order of r-squared
- Created second loop to add variables to multiple linear regression one at a time
- Visualised to determine optimal variables to include in the final model while adhering to the principle of parsimony
