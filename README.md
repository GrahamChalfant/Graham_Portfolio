### [Advanced Data Analysis: Regression Variable Selection ](https://github.com/GrahamChalfant/Advanced_Data_Analysis_Project)

The image displayed below is the r-squared associated with each predictor variable.

The variables above were sorted by greatest r-squared in descending order. These variables were then added to a regression model, one at a time, by r-squared. This was done in order to determine the variables which should be included in the final model. The visualization below shows how each additianl variable contributed to the adjusted r-squared.

Not all varaibels were included in the model to adhear to the principal of parciomony.
