## My projects:

### Dissertation: Relationship Between Trump's Twitter Sentiment and His Approval Ratings


### Healthcare Social Determinates of Health 


### [Advanced Data Analysis: Regression Variable Selection ](https://github.com/GrahamChalfant/Advanced_Data_Analysis_Project)

This project was based on the SkillCraft_Dataset.csv. The SkillSet_Dataset file contains video game telemetric data from a cognitive study of a Complex SKill Leaning project.

Objective: What affects the expert level? How can the players improve their level?

- Created loop to find r-squared of each independent variable
- Rearranged data using dplyr package to list variables in order of r-squared
- Created the second loop to add variables to multiple linear regression one at a time
- Visualised to determine optimal variables to include in the final model while adhering to the principle of parsimony

### [Data_Management_Project: Database Design](https://github.com/GrahamChalfant/Data_Management_Project)

My team and I had to create a database for a hotel chain from the business problem found in group_project_description_2020. We created an ER diagram in order to determine cardinality, relationships, and entities. The actual database was created in R using the RSQLite package, and this code can be seen in my Data_Management_Poject repository.

Below is part of the ER diagram created for this project.

### Business Statistics 

 
### [Customer Transaction Prediction Project](https://github.com/GrahamChalfant/Customer_Transaction_Prediction_Project)

During my master's program, my team and I had to create a customer transaction prediction system. We applied various ML models, including GLM, Decision Trees, SVM, and Regression.

Key decisions and findings include:
1. Applied various data balacing methods to the
2. example
3.

If I could do this project over, I would have narrowed our focus on a smaller number of models.
