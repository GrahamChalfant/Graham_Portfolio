## My projects:

### Dissertation: Relationship Between Trump's Twitter Sentiment and His Approval Ratings


### Healthcare Social Determinates of Health 


### [Advanced Data Analysis: MLR Analysis](https://github.com/GrahamChalfant/Advanced_Data_Analysis_Project)

- Used MLR in order to determine the influence each predictor variables on the outcome variable
- Found r-squared of each independent variable using loops
- Rearranged data using dplyr to order variables in order of r-squared
- Created MLR adding each independent variable, one at a time, based on r-squared in descending order using a loop
- Visualised MLR's adjusted r-squared by each variable added in order to determine the optimal number of variables 

The image below shows the MLR's adjusted r-squared as each respective variable was added. The final model needed to consider two things: total adjusted r-squared and the principal of parsimony. From the below image, I felt that the optimal model contained all variables until "TotalHours." This model had an adjusted r-squared which was 1% less than the maximum but contained three fewer variables.

### [Data_Management_Project: Database Design](https://github.com/GrahamChalfant/Data_Management_Project)

My team and I had to create a database for a hotel chain from the business problem found in group_project_description_2020. We created an ER diagram in order to determine cardinality, relationships, and entities. The actual database was created in R using the RSQLite package, and this code can be seen in my Data_Management_Poject repository.

Below is part of the ER diagram created for this project.

### Business Statistics 

 
### [Customer Transaction Prediction Project](https://github.com/GrahamChalfant/Customer_Transaction_Prediction_Project)

During my master's program, my team and I had to create a customer transaction prediction system. We applied various ML models, including GLM, Decision Trees, SVM, and Regression.

Key decisions and findings include:
1. Applied various data balancing methods to the
2. example
3.

If I could do this project over, I would have narrowed our focus on a smaller number of models.
