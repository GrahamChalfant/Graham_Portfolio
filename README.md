### Dissertation: Relationship Between Trump's Twitter Sentiment and His Approval Ratings


### Healthcare Social Determinates of Health 


### [Advanced Data Analysis: Regression Variable Selection ](https://github.com/GrahamChalfant/Advanced_Data_Analysis_Project)

The objective of this project was to display an understanding of SPSS and specific ML algorithms. 

My team and I answered the following questions about the SkillSet_Dataset file, which contains video game telemetric data from a cognitive study of a Complex SKill Leaning project.

1. What affects the expert level? How can the players improve their level? 
2. Are there any identifiable sets or “groups” of players within the data? If so, what are their distinguishing features? 
3. Investigate the association of the different variables. How many hidden factors are related to these characteristics? Can you interpret these factors?

I had to answer **question one**. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to uncover what influenced player level. I chose regression analysis because of its ability to explain the outcome variable based on the relative contribution of the predictor variables.

I carried out the data preparation and modelling in r-studio. I found r-studio to be much more robust and allow more room for customization. So, I carried out the complete analysis in r-studio and then confirmed my findings in SPSS. Major decisions and key findings included: 

- Tested assumptions: normality, homoscedasticity, linearity, multicollinearity
- Found r-squared of each independent varaible using loops
- Rearranged data using dplyr to order variables in order of r-squared
- Created MLR adding each independent variable, one at a time, based on r-squared in descening order using a loop
- Visualised MLR's adjusted r-squred by each varaible added in order to deteming optimal number of variable 

The image below shows the MLR's adjusted r-squared as each respective variable was added.

### [Data_Management_Project: Database Design](https://github.com/GrahamChalfant/Data_Management_Project)

My team and I had to create a database for a hotel chain from the business problem found in group_project_description_2020. We created an ER diagram in order to determine cardinality, relationships, and entities. The actual database was created in R using the RSQLite package, and this code can be seen in my Data_Management_Poject repository.

Below is part of the ER diagram created for this project.

### [Customer Transaction Prediction Project](https://github.com/GrahamChalfant/Customer_Transaction_Prediction_Project)

During my master's program, my team and I had to create a customer transaction prediction system. We applied various ML models, including GLM, Decision Trees, SVM, and Regression.

Key decisions and findings include:
1. Applied various data balacing methods to the
2. example
3.

If I could do this project over, I would have narrowed our focus on a smaller number of models.
