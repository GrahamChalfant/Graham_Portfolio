### [Advanced Data Analysis: Regression Variable Selection ](https://github.com/GrahamChalfant/Advanced_Data_Analysis_Project)

This project was based on the SkillCraft_Dataset.csv. The SkillSet_Dataset file contains video game telemtric data from a cognitive study of a Complex SKill Leaning project.

Objective: What affects the expert level? How can the players improve their level?

- Created loop to find r-squared of each independent variable
- Rearanged data using dplyr package to list variables in order of r-squred
- Craeted second loop to add varaibles to multiple linear regression one at a time
- Visulized to determine optimal variables to include in final model while adhearing to principle of parsimony
